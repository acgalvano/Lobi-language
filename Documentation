Overview:
The site is all on one page, which is index.html, which utilizes LobiScript.jsx, utils.jsx, and several other scripts such as React.
The other files will be expanded in more detail.

LobiScript.jsx is the primary location of the site formating and page functionality. This imports from React, and creates variables from the
narratives.json and sentences.json files. Additionally, it contains a boolean 'global_show_french' which functions as the toggle for
displaying the English versus French pages. The json files are processed through Promise.

Each visible page on the site is represented by a React.createClass variable, there is one for English and one for French, displayed by
the toggle. These pages include the About, Orthography, Texts, Concordance, Search, and Glossing tabs. 

StoryView and StoryViewFR parse the story data, which is collected from the sentences.json and narratives.json. It also handles the
formating of the gloss and the Texts page. The stories are created on the Texts page by accessing the narratives.json

narratives.json: each narrative in the json requires an id and a key value. The key value in narratives must match the key value for each
entry of that story in sentences.json. Additionally, the "name", "name_fr", "author", "link" and "linkFR" are necessary for the Texts page
and the individual story pages to function. The name and name_fr are the title of the Text, the author is additionally listed and the link
must be the embed video link to the video corresponding to the toggled language.

sentences.json: each line from twisted tongues should be represented as a unique entry in this json, with a requirement for the id of lines
from the same story to match. This is important for the Texts page to function.
